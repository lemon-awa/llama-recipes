The key idea is to exploit the inherent structure in U-relevance relations to prune large numbers of interpretations.","labels":"[1.2768 7.9705] The authors propose the MiniCon algorithm, a novel algorithm for finding the maximally-contained rewriting of a conjunctive query using a set of conjunctive views. | [1.3401 7.9676] This paper investigates and provides evidence that the inefficiency of bottom-up knowledge compilation is due to the bottom-up paradigm itself, even for CNF formulas which have very small circuit representations in structured decomposable negation normal forms (str-DNNF), one of the most general languages. | [1.3528 7.9698] The study proposes the Extended Disjunctive Normal Form (EDNF), a basis for processing logic queries in loosely coupled environments, which extends the relational algebra expressions to include recursion.
